A repository for complete, standalone Python modules for diverse functionality.

This repository doesn't exist for the purpose of being a portfolio; instead, it aims to store a personal collection of .py files, each providing complete and independent functionality.

Anyway, they are codes meant to function without errors, be well-written, and documented. Useful out-of-the-box scripts for various contexts.
